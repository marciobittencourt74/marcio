I have been doing illustrations and drawings since I was a child, and with the arrival of the internet I saw the possibility of working with what I have always liked.
In the beginning I had the help of friends who supported me and made it easier for me to use their facilities for my development.
I have been working on creating websites, graphic pieces and flash animations since 2003, when I entered the area of ​​web content management, improving my knowledge of programming languages.
I like to work by inserting my creativity into the things I do, professionally and personally.
